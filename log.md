# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) I left a few weeks ago and finished 4 challenges.

**Thoughts**: I stopped doing the challenges a while ago because of work, and thought I was too busy to complete them. But today I could see how much I can do in just an hour and how it would be a waste not to continue this Challenge everyday!

### Day 1: January 7, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Started the day by some reading (*JavaScript: The Good Parts* by *Douglas Crockford*). Also did 2  [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges and stopped on the third (Fibonacci numbers...). 

**Thoughts**: Today I felt that I could use some JavaScript but it didn't mean I could understand it. Some concepts are really hard to grasp. The hardest part may be that sometimes I feel like I get it...but in fact I don't...

### Day 2: January 8, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Tweaked a bit more my server, learned how to add a monitoring system and how to hide it behind Nginx. I decided to publish some of my notes about managing a Linux server. After that I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges. Broke my head on another mathematical challenge (Prime numbers...) so I deciced to try some other one.

**Thoughts**: I really am not good with mathematiques! Everytime i feel like I get it, I don't... Hope I'll have enought ime tomorrow to clear my head and give another go to these challenges.
