# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) I left a few weeks ago and finished 4 challenges.

**Thoughts**: I stopped doing the challenges a while ago because of work, and thought I was too busy to complete them. But today I could see how much I can do in just an hour and how it would be a waste not to continue this Challenge everyday!
