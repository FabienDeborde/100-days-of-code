# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) I left a few weeks ago and finished 4 challenges.

**Thoughts**: I stopped doing the challenges a while ago because of work, and thought I was too busy to complete them. But today I could see how much I can do in just an hour and how it would be a waste not to continue this Challenge everyday!

### Day 1: January 7, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Started the day by some reading (*JavaScript: The Good Parts* by *Douglas Crockford*). Also did 2  [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges and stopped on the third (Fibonacci numbers...). 

**Thoughts**: Today I felt that I could use some JavaScript but it didn't mean I could understand it. Some concepts are really hard to grasp. The hardest part may be that sometimes I feel like I get it...but in fact I don't...

### Day 2: January 8, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Tweaked a bit more my server, learned how to add a monitoring system and how to hide it behind Nginx. I decided to publish some of my notes about managing a Linux server. After that I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges. Broke my head on another mathematical challenge (Prime numbers...) so I deciced to try some other one.

**Thoughts**: I really am not good with mathematiques! Everytime i feel like I get it, I don't... Hope I'll have enought ime tomorrow to clear my head and give another go to these challenges.

### Day 3: January 9, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Spent a very long day working on the 'Coming Soon' page of the company I'm starting with my wife. It made me use some scripts I built a few months ago (timer, language switcher, form sending via AJAX). I found some energy left to finish an [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenge. I tried another one but my brain wouldn't follow. I'll try again tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: I really loved touching old scripts I made a while ago. I wish I could stay concentrated for more than 14h but I guess it makes me feel more human...

### Day 4: January 10, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a bit more about SEO and also server HTTP headers. I found the time to complete 3 [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges. 

**Thoughts**: I was wondering today how to conciliate new technologies with our actual browsers. Some design I made was "perfect" on Chrome/Firefox/Opera but looked terrible on Safari... I should probably use more css frameworks but the flexbox model is so simple and so efficient I don't understand why it is always messed up on IE and Safari and really wonder how I should get around this problem. To finish on a good note, only 4 intermediate challenges left! (but 3 are maths, and another is...closure! I think it's THE concept i might be able to use sometimes but can't get myself to explain it and fully understand it).

3. [Drop it](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/drop-it)

### Day 5: January 11, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned more about Nginx and server config (most of it was security and SEO related). I also took some time to finish the 3 [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges that were harrassing my brain for a while. 

**Thoughts**: I feel more and more attracted to logical programming (opposed to the design programming, not sure if I'm using the proper terms here... I mean I like more and more using Javascript or manipulating server config files, while I don't feel as much enthusiasm when I use HTML/Jade and CSS/SASS). I think I like the challenge of inputting logic in stuff. <br>
I also felt today that sometimes you need to take a step back of your script and take another look at it another day to be able to find the solution. The 3 challenges I had left was some mathematical challenges I struggled on few days ago, and I was able to understand them today a lot faster.<br>
Also, I think I used some closure concept in today's scripts but still can't grasp the concept clearly so....tomorrow will be more about closure !!!

### Day 6: January 13, Friday
**Today's Progress**: I had to format and reinstall my computer yesterday so I couldn't work on any project...I'll have to work twice as much this weekend!! Today I finally finished the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges! 

**Thoughts**: I think I'm finally getting a better understanding about what are closures and how to use them. I've read a lot of different explanation and I like this one : it's a function with preserved data (and also basically it is "just" outer value that are usable inside of a function). I really feel that is a powerful feature of JavaScript and I really need to understand and use it better.

### Day 7: January 14, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Started the [Advanced Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseAdvancedAlgorithmScripting) challenges! Working on the RegExp first challenge, almost there but still have 3 errors so I think I need to take a step back and come back to it later. I have learned a lot about Git (specially Git Flow) today and can't wait to use it in my next project. 

**Thoughts**: There is so many things I want/need/feel the urge to learn and understand, that it is really hard sometimes to stay on only one path. Today I stopped my JavaScript training to take a closer look on Git and Git Flow, and also checked some SASS. It felt good to taste some other technologies. Went back to JavaScript a bit later and it felt also good to come back to it.

### Day 8: January 15, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Did 2 [Advanced Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseAdvancedAlgorithmScripting) challenges!

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I finished the first RegExp challenge, I wanted to learn more about RegExp but never took the time.

### Day 9: January 16, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Today I rethought my workflow, tried to optimize my projects folders structure, and tried to transition from Prepros to WebPack. 

**Thoughts**: This rethinking process took me a lot more time than I anticipated. I feel like my workflow is going to be better, but I have a lot of issues with SASS and PUG processing and live reloading with WebPack. I don't know if I should use both while I learn more of WebPack.

**Link(s) to work**
I'll publish my boilerplate once its ready

### Day 10: January 17, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I've been working more on Webpack.Finally got hot reloading to work, and SASS process to a main CSS file. Now stuck on preprocessing my index.jade to index.html.

**Thoughts**: No idea if I should love or hate webpack. This tool seems so powerful yet so undocumented and all examples I found on the Web are either not working or way too advanced or both...

**Link(s) to work**
I'll publish my boilerplate once its ready

### Day 11: January 18, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I spent again a lot of time on webpack. I got my final final structure (I hope) amd I got SASS and live reload to really work, then had PUG working until I realized live reloading was not working anymore. In the end thought I had fixed everything and started working on codeship integration. I found how to config it and had test and deployment settings to discover that my PUG preprocessing was still bugged... More tomorrow....

**Thoughts**: Really really impressed at how Prepros is doing such a great job out of the box when I compare to Webpack. Sure it is probably less powerful and configurable, but it just works when you need preprocessing and live reloading stuff. Webpack seems to be able to everything and anything but serioulsy this is so unwell documentated. I just want to do simple stuff and I can't seem to find the right configuration for it.

**Link(s) to work**
I'll publish my boilerplate once its ready

### Day 12: January 19, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Finished my boilerplate using Webpack, Jade, SASS and autoprefixer. The live reloading is working-ish (work on all save except Jade includes). I also integrated it with Codeship for continuous integration and deployment. Also I made a repo with the my new starter kit.

**Thoughts**: I'm really glad I could get it to work, but had to revert back for my next production project to Prepros. I really feel the power of Webpack but it is way too hard to configure and had way too much "bug" (probably me not configuring well). All was working until I wanted to add Bootstrap, and then needed also Tether and then everything was just broken. Took me 5 minutes to delete Webpack and NPM and configure Prepros to preprocess and minify my SASS and PUG and also concatenate/minify my main.js and vendors.js... I really want to understand Webpack but around 3 days for a buggy config vs 5 minutes to configure something working out of the box... feels like an easy choice to me.
I think it might be easier to understand Webpack when I start learning React. And maybe when they release the doc for Webpack 2.

### Day 13: January 20, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Today I finished Node.js and Express.js, Git and MongoDB exercices. I've also set my environment to start API Projects. I also learned a bit more about Nginx and password protection in order to start a new private project.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I listened to a podcast and heard an advice that seems maybe weird but it was something like "learn a framework, not a language", and I think it is quite the same kind of objective as this challenge. Theory is great but pratical training is the key to success. So I decided to continue my Algorithm Challenges but I'll learn at the same time some MERN stack!!

### Day 14: January 21, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Today I finished *JavaScript: The Good Parts* by *Douglas Crockford*. I also finished the first API project, and am now struggling with Heroku deployment. I also started to learn React on CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 15: January 22, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Today I found the way to deploy from Cloud9 to Heroku. I had to add a script in my package.json that would run before Heroku run npm start and install Express dependency. Also continued to learn a bit of React on Codeacademy.

**Thoughts**: So many things to learn and so little time is the feeling of the day. It's also getting a bit hard to maintain the habit of keeping a log and tweeting about it.

### Day 16: January 23, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked a lot on a private project (Jade/SASS), practiced more on my new workflow and Git Flow. I could also continue my learning of React through CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts**: Feels like I'm working a bit faster but it's still too messy to my taste. I need to be more organized and recognize faster the pattern I could use to less reapeat myself.

Nothing to show today!

### Day 17: January 24, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on a private project all day. Did almost all the Jade/Sass markup and tried a few things with Bootstrap.

**Thoughts**: I'm not a big fan of Bootstrap, I like the cross-browser compatibility (had way less problem with Bootstrap than with just Sass on Safari...) but it's taking so much more Jade markup and it's a bit too restrictive sometimes so I still need to add quite a lot of Sass.

### Day 18: January 25, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Almost finished this side project. Had some issues with iOS browsers (as usual...).

**Thoughts**: I'm quite tired, don't have much thought of today's work beside I still have a long way to learn how to be more efficient.

### Day 19: January 26, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Changed my hosting, learned a few things about DNS records, had to change my server config too. Also finished my first release of my side project. It's still in test for now, most of the bugs are fixed. I'm starting to implement i18n.

**Thoughts**: I need to be more organized when it comes to testing. Also can't wait to be able to use React for production project, seems it's a lot easier for i18n.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 20: January 27, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day trying to solve DNS issues. I found some time to continue working on my project and finish the i18n implementation. Still need a lot of testing.

**Thoughts**: I really can't wait to solve this DNS issues to be able to concentrate more on developement and front end!!

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 21: January 28, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Finished adding English and Japanese to my project! Have also done some tests and found a way to switch fonts depending on the language.

**Thoughts**: This DNS problems are still there but I'm glad I could concentrate a bit more today on front end. I really want to get this over to try to find a new way to implement i18n and SEO measures.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 22: January 29, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Added French support today. Also been fixing some minor UI bugs around menus and i18n.

**Thoughts**: Really long day working on the French version. I'm glad I could find some time to fix issues in my js files.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 23: January 30, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Finished the 1st official version of my project. Did a lot of testing and bug fixing (specially for Safari/Mac related versions). Now trying to get it online as DNS problems are still there...

**Thoughts**: I really wonder if it was a good idea to leave DigitalOcean to a managed hosting...It's taking them forever to fix issues.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 24: January 31, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Long day of debugging, testing on windows, linux, mac, tablet, mobile etc... Almost done with the technical stuff, next is the content. Also the DNS problem is finally fixed, and I could config the server the way I wanted.

**Thoughts**: Using a lot different services for my freelancing, but today I got the feeling I could make some of these services inhouse.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 25: February 01, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Today was another testing/debugging day. Also learned a lot about SEO, Open Graph, Twitter Card, JSON-LD and Microdata...Took me some time get how all of this works.

**Thoughts**: I really didn't think SEO was so full of settings and different files, and even language. I'll have to take another look at schema.org...

**Link(s) to work**
Almost ready to publish

### Day 26: February 02, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Finished a lot of SEO testing today. Also went back to some i18n testing as I saw some mistakes.

**Thoughts**: Really want to finish this so I can go back to more javascript studies (really want to start using React!)

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 27: February 03, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Did some i18n testing then set up a new server to test my new projects. I've been stuck with email security for a few hours but should be working now.

**Thoughts**: I'm really not a huge fan of email setup on servers. Too many configurations and so many tests to do. Can't wait to go back to some JavaScript!

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 28: February 04, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Today I've created a new droplet and set it to serve 2 new domains. Did a lot of configuration to improve security and the server can send notification without being classified as spam.

**Thoughts**: Really love how simple it is to run a server on DigitalOcean! Linux is really a fun environment to work in, but it's so deep that I wonder if I'll ever be able to fully use it.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 29: February 05, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Added more stuff to the server. Now go to some info about CPU and Mem usage. Also working on a backup automated process.

**Thoughts**: Having some difficulties with Linux and also the server perf. I think I'll have to up it a bit.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 30: February 06, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Finished the server config! Also installed Ghost.

**Thoughts**: Spend a lot of time once again on server config. I'll really have to learn more about linux and server administration.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 31: February 07, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Started to configure Ghost website. Also learned and practiced a bit more nodejs and express.

**Thoughts**: Ghost is a really nice CMS to work with. It's way faster than WordPress but also more limited for now as there is no plugin yet. I really liked the backend learning today.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 32: February 08, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: More learning and practicing with nodejs and express today.

**Thoughts**: I still got a long way to go but I feel like I'm progressing. Now that I have to basis on node I'll move to React.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 33: February 09, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Today started working on React. I've got some project ideas that I want to try using React.

**Thoughts**: Having a hard time concentrate since yesterday. I really hate winter cold...

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 34: February 13, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Back after a weekend trip! Today I learned more about React and finished a quick demo. I'll up it soon when I finish the design.

**Thoughts**: Really like the thinking process of React and its modularity. Can't wait to be more efficient with it!

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 35: February 14, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: More work on React! Also just started learning about Redux.

**Thoughts**: Just read about Redux and am not sure what it is all about. I'm a bit confused about the React "state" and the Redux "state" meanings...

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 36: February 15, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Continued the work on redux.

**Thoughts**: Still confused about redux "state" and react "state" but I feel like redux is just a link between data and react. 

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 37: February 18, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Today I went back to some React basis, I really need to grasp the core concepts.

**Thoughts**: Back after 2 days without Internet (seems the building optic fiber was cut or something...). I read a bit about React but couldn't practice cause...no cdn, no npm and no react on the hard drive. Glad Internet is finally back!

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 38: February 22, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Today worked on Meteor basics.

**Thoughts**: Just discovered about Meteor and find it very useful to start quickly a Node project. Can't wait to use Meteor with React!

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 39: February 23, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: More work on Meteor with React. Almost ready to start a new project!

**Thoughts**: Really loved working with Meteor + React today! It feels really intuitive and find it way easier to grasp than react + redux for now. I could use a bit of Mongo too so I'm really happy!

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 40: February 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on my new project structure and started preparing my server for deployment. Got stuck on MUP config...

**Thoughts**: Thought deployment with Meteor who be easier and quicker but can't find any up to date good guide to config MUP. I'll have to spend more time on this tomorrow.
