# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) I left a few weeks ago and finished 4 challenges.

**Thoughts**: I stopped doing the challenges a while ago because of work, and thought I was too busy to complete them. But today I could see how much I can do in just an hour and how it would be a waste not to continue this Challenge everyday!

### Day 1: January 7, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Started the day by some reading (*JavaScript: The Good Parts* by *Douglas Crockford*). Also did 2  [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges and stopped on the third (Fibonacci numbers...). 

**Thoughts**: Today I felt that I could use some JavaScript but it didn't mean I could understand it. Some concepts are really hard to grasp. The hardest part may be that sometimes I feel like I get it...but in fact I don't...

### Day 2: January 8, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Tweaked a bit more my server, learned how to add a monitoring system and how to hide it behind Nginx. I decided to publish some of my notes about managing a Linux server. After that I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges. Broke my head on another mathematical challenge (Prime numbers...) so I deciced to try some other one.

**Thoughts**: I really am not good with mathematiques! Everytime i feel like I get it, I don't... Hope I'll have enought ime tomorrow to clear my head and give another go to these challenges.

### Day 3: January 9, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Spent a very long day working on the 'Coming Soon' page of the company I'm starting with my wife. It made me use some scripts I built a few months ago (timer, language switcher, form sending via AJAX). I found some energy left to finish an [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenge. I tried another one but my brain wouldn't follow. I'll try again tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: I really loved touching old scripts I made a while ago. I wish I could stay concentrated for more than 14h but I guess it makes me feel more human...

### Day 4: January 10, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a bit more about SEO and also server HTTP headers. I found the time to complete 3 [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges. 

**Thoughts**: I was wondering today how to conciliate new technologies with our actual browsers. Some design I made was "perfect" on Chrome/Firefox/Opera but looked terrible on Safari... I should probably use more css frameworks but the flexbox model is so simple and so efficient I don't understand why it is always messed up on IE and Safari and really wonder how I should get around this problem. To finish on a good note, only 4 intermediate challenges left! (but 3 are maths, and another is...closure! I think it's THE concept i might be able to use sometimes but can't get myself to explain it and fully understand it).

### Day 5: January 11, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned more about Nginx and server config (most of it was security and SEO related). I also took some time to finish the 3 [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges that were harrassing my brain for a while. 

**Thoughts**: I feel more and more attracted to logical programming (opposed to the design programming, not sure if I'm using the proper terms here... I mean I like more and more using Javascript or manipulating server config files, while I don't feel as much enthusiasm when I use HTML/Jade and CSS/SASS). I think I like the challenge of inputting logic in stuff. <br>
I also felt today that sometimes you need to take a step back of your script and take another look at it another day to be able to find the solution. The 3 challenges I had left was some mathematical challenges I struggled on few days ago, and I was able to understand them today a lot faster.<br>
Also, I think I used some closure concept in today's scripts but still can't grasp the concept clearly so....tomorrow will be more about closure !!!

### Day 6: January 13, Friday
**Today's Progress**: I had to format and reinstall my computer yesterday so I couldn't work on any project...I'll have to work twice as much this weekend!! Today I finally finished the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges! 

**Thoughts**: I think I'm finally getting a better understanding about what are closures and how to use them. I've read a lot of different explanation and I like this one : it's a function with preserved data (and also basically it is "just" outer value that are usable inside of a function). I really feel that is a powerful feature of JavaScript and I really need to understand and use it better.

### Day 7: January 14, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Started the [Advanced Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseAdvancedAlgorithmScripting) challenges! Working on the RegExp first challenge, almost there but still have 3 errors so I think I need to take a step back and come back to it later. I have learned a lot about Git (specially Git Flow) today and can't wait to use it in my next project. 

**Thoughts**: There is so many things I want/need/feel the urge to learn and understand, that it is really hard sometimes to stay on only one path. Today I stopped my JavaScript training to take a closer look on Git and Git Flow, and also checked some SASS. It felt good to taste some other technologies. Went back to JavaScript a bit later and it felt also good to come back to it.
