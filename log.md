# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) I left a few weeks ago and finished 4 challenges.

**Thoughts**: I stopped doing the challenges a while ago because of work, and thought I was too busy to complete them. But today I could see how much I can do in just an hour and how it would be a waste not to continue this Challenge everyday!

### Day 1: January 7, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Started the day by some reading (*JavaScript: The Good Parts* by *Douglas Crockford*). Also did 2  [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges and stopped on the third (Fibonacci numbers...). 

**Thoughts**: Today I felt that I could use some JavaScript but it didn't mean I could understand it. Some concepts are really hard to grasp. The hardest part may be that sometimes I feel like I get it...but in fact I don't...

### Day 2: January 8, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Tweaked a bit more my server, learned how to add a monitoring system and how to hide it behind Nginx. I decided to publish some of my notes about managing a Linux server. After that I went back to the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges. Broke my head on another mathematical challenge (Prime numbers...) so I deciced to try some other one.

**Thoughts**: I really am not good with mathematiques! Everytime i feel like I get it, I don't... Hope I'll have enought ime tomorrow to clear my head and give another go to these challenges.

### Day 3: January 9, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Spent a very long day working on the 'Coming Soon' page of the company I'm starting with my wife. It made me use some scripts I built a few months ago (timer, language switcher, form sending via AJAX). I found some energy left to finish an [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenge. I tried another one but my brain wouldn't follow. I'll try again tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: I really loved touching old scripts I made a while ago. I wish I could stay concentrated for more than 14h but I guess it makes me feel more human...

### Day 4: January 10, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a bit more about SEO and also server HTTP headers. I found the time to complete 3 [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges. 

**Thoughts**: I was wondering today how to conciliate new technologies with our actual browsers. Some design I made was "perfect" on Chrome/Firefox/Opera but looked terrible on Safari... I should probably use more css frameworks but the flexbox model is so simple and so efficient I don't understand why it is always messed up on IE and Safari and really wonder how I should get around this problem. To finish on a good note, only 4 intermediate challenges left! (but 3 are maths, and another is...closure! I think it's THE concept i might be able to use sometimes but can't get myself to explain it and fully understand it).

### Day 5: January 11, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned more about Nginx and server config (most of it was security and SEO related). I also took some time to finish the 3 [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges that were harrassing my brain for a while. 

**Thoughts**: I feel more and more attracted to logical programming (opposed to the design programming, not sure if I'm using the proper terms here... I mean I like more and more using Javascript or manipulating server config files, while I don't feel as much enthusiasm when I use HTML/Jade and CSS/SASS). I think I like the challenge of inputting logic in stuff. <br>
I also felt today that sometimes you need to take a step back of your script and take another look at it another day to be able to find the solution. The 3 challenges I had left was some mathematical challenges I struggled on few days ago, and I was able to understand them today a lot faster.<br>
Also, I think I used some closure concept in today's scripts but still can't grasp the concept clearly so....tomorrow will be more about closure !!!

### Day 6: January 13, Friday
**Today's Progress**: I had to format and reinstall my computer yesterday so I couldn't work on any project...I'll have to work twice as much this weekend!! Today I finally finished the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) challenges! 

**Thoughts**: I think I'm finally getting a better understanding about what are closures and how to use them. I've read a lot of different explanation and I like this one : it's a function with preserved data (and also basically it is "just" outer value that are usable inside of a function). I really feel that is a powerful feature of JavaScript and I really need to understand and use it better.

### Day 7: January 14, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Started the [Advanced Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseAdvancedAlgorithmScripting) challenges! Working on the RegExp first challenge, almost there but still have 3 errors so I think I need to take a step back and come back to it later. I have learned a lot about Git (specially Git Flow) today and can't wait to use it in my next project. 

**Thoughts**: There is so many things I want/need/feel the urge to learn and understand, that it is really hard sometimes to stay on only one path. Today I stopped my JavaScript training to take a closer look on Git and Git Flow, and also checked some SASS. It felt good to taste some other technologies. Went back to JavaScript a bit later and it felt also good to come back to it.

### Day 8: January 15, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Did 2 [Advanced Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseAdvancedAlgorithmScripting) challenges!

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I finished the first RegExp challenge, I wanted to learn more about RegExp but never took the time.

### Day 9: January 16, Monday
**Today's Progress**: Today I rethought my workflow, tried to optimize my projects folders structure, and tried to transition from Prepros to WebPack. 

**Thoughts**: This rethinking process took me a lot more time than I anticipated. I feel like my workflow is going to be better, but I have a lot of issues with SASS and PUG processing and live reloading with WebPack. I don't know if I should use both while I learn more of WebPack.

I'll publish my boilerplate once its ready

### Day 10: January 17, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I've been working more on Webpack.Finally got hot reloading to work, and SASS process to a main CSS file. Now stuck on preprocessing my index.jade to index.html.

**Thoughts**: No idea if I should love or hate webpack. This tool seems so powerful yet so undocumented and all examples I found on the Web are either not working or way too advanced or both...

I'll publish my boilerplate once its ready

### Day 11: January 18, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I spent again a lot of time on webpack. I got my final final structure (I hope) amd I got SASS and live reload to really work, then had PUG working until I realized live reloading was not working anymore. In the end thought I had fixed everything and started working on codeship integration. I found how to config it and had test and deployment settings to discover that my PUG preprocessing was still bugged... More tomorrow....

**Thoughts**: Really really impressed at how Prepros is doing such a great job out of the box when I compare to Webpack. Sure it is probably less powerful and configurable, but it just works when you need preprocessing and live reloading stuff. Webpack seems to be able to everything and anything but serioulsy this is so unwell documentated. I just want to do simple stuff and I can't seem to find the right configuration for it.

I'll publish my boilerplate once its ready

### Day 12: January 19, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Finished my boilerplate using Webpack, Jade, SASS and autoprefixer. The live reloading is working-ish (work on all save except Jade includes). I also integrated it with Codeship for continuous integration and deployment. Also I made a repo with the my new starter kit.

**Thoughts**: I'm really glad I could get it to work, but had to revert back for my next production project to Prepros. I really feel the power of Webpack but it is way too hard to configure and had way too much "bug" (probably me not configuring well). All was working until I wanted to add Bootstrap, and then needed also Tether and then everything was just broken. Took me 5 minutes to delete Webpack and NPM and configure Prepros to preprocess and minify my SASS and PUG and also concatenate/minify my main.js and vendors.js... I really want to understand Webpack but around 3 days for a buggy config vs 5 minutes to configure something working out of the box... feels like an easy choice to me.
I think it might be easier to understand Webpack when I start learning React. And maybe when they release the doc for Webpack 2.

### Day 13: January 20, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Today I finished Node.js and Express.js, Git and MongoDB exercices. I've also set my environment to start API Projects. I also learned a bit more about Nginx and password protection in order to start a new private project.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I listened to a podcast and heard an advice that seems maybe weird but it was something like "learn a framework, not a language", and I think it is quite the same kind of objective as this challenge. Theory is great but pratical training is the key to success. So I decided to continue my Algorithm Challenges but I'll learn at the same time some MERN stack!!

### Day 14: January 21, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Today I finished *JavaScript: The Good Parts* by *Douglas Crockford*. I also finished the first API project, and am now struggling with Heroku deployment. I also started to learn React on CodeAcademy.
